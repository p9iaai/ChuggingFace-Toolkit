# Important Notice Regarding Spaces API Usage in the ChuggingFace Toolkit

This document clarifies the usage of cloned Spaces in the ChuggingFace Toolkit. While some API endpoints reference `p9iaai/`, these Spaces are not original creations but rather clones of existing Spaces from the ðŸ¤—HuggingFace community.

## Purpose of Cloning

The Spaces were cloned to ensure toolkit functionality persists even if the original Spaces become unavailable. This approach maintains reliability while leveraging existing solutions from the ðŸ¤—HuggingFace ecosystem.

## Attribution and Usage

Each API documentation file in this directory explicitly states the source of the cloned Space. To use the original Space instead of the cloned version, simply modify the endpoint in the respective scripts.

## Future Development

While the current implementation utilizes existing Spaces, future versions of this toolkit will incorporate original Spaces developed specifically for this project. These additions will expand the toolkit's capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing solutions.
